    "On this project we want to build morphological metrics of the buildings according to the information provided by the Open Buildings project of Google for a specific region on Buenos Aires, Argentina. The goal is to create images with a resolution of 10x10 meters that represent the buildings density and orientation of the buildings on the region. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "The data source is a file available on [Open Building project](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-buildings-data/v3/polygons_s2_level_4_gzip/95b_buildings.csv.gz). This file contains the polygons of the buildings in the region. Based on this polygons we want to create the images with the morphological metrics. This file need to be fetched and unzipped because it can't be stored into the online repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to process the data we decided to take a subset of all the information available on the file. We created on DataPreparation.ipynb (using tools.py the main list of functions) the option to create smaller CSV files with just the entries that correspond to a specific region around some desired long-lat coordinates. This es only previous step that you need to run previously to be able to run the general pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data is very clean and healthy, so it's necessary to make any kind of cleaning. The data itself has a column called \"confidence\", but we don't used that column because we assume that the provided data is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry has the Polygon with the shape and location of the building and an ID (\"full_plus_code\", a system of Google to tag places) that is unique for each building. Also each entry has the area (in meters) of the building (that match with expected area of the polygon based on the coordinates) and the coordinates for the building that match approx the center of the polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this data we first define a grid size, by default 10x10 meters (but it could be changed on settings) and then the main task is to correlate witch building belows each cell. Due the cell size is similar to the size of the buildings, it's very common that a cell has more than a building but also that a building hast parts that belong to different cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid make al algorithm that groves O(n^2) with the size of the sample (if we check every cell against every building overlapping) we decide to build the cells on an arbitrary coordinate system where each cell has a unitary numbering system on each direction (north-south ans east-west). So we center the numbering system on the center of the region and make a grid that goes from -N/2 to +N/2 where N is the number of times that the cell size in meters fit on the region. So the $cell_{00}$ is the central cell and the $cell_{-N/2-N/2}$ is the cell that is on the left bottom corner of the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The the question is how to assign the buildings to the corresponding cells. To do that we take the coordinate of the building (we use here the reported one) and first we subtract in both axis the coordinates of the center of the region. Then we divide the result by the cell size and round to the nearest integer. This way we get the cell coordinates that corresponds to the building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to check if the building overlaps with contiguous cells. To do that we take the max distance between the point of the building Polygon and divide it by 2. This is the \"radius\" that we need to check around. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this information for each building we create a dictionary with the cell coordinates and we populate it with square Polygons that represent the cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "With both objects we iterate over each building once and we check if the building Polygon overlaps any of the rounding to the building cells, and when there is overlap we add that information to the building entry. So we have the connection between the building and the cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this information we could now iterate over the cells and check for each cell witch buildings are inside. The needed information to calculate the covered area is already calculated on this stage because is just add all overlaps areas on the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Orientations calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to detect the orientation of the buildings we need to determine how to make it. There is many ways, one is to perform a PCA over the point that define the Polygon, other is to search for the small rectangle that contains the Polygon and then calculate the angle of the rectangle (here again we need some kind of PCA). The problem of working with the PCA is that PCA over the original Polygon coordinates could have biases due the fact than complex morphologies have not homogeneous distribution of points, so if we make a PCA over the original coordinates we could get a biases orientation. The most simple realization of this problem is that all closed Polygons have a duplicated point (the first and the last point are the same). To avoid this problems we decided to combine both methods. We first search for the small rectangle that contains the Polygon and then we calculate the PCA of the points of the rectangle (dropping the last one).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate the PCA we have another advantage, the main autovector provides the orientation, but also the relationship between the two autovectors provides the elongation (or eccentricity) of the building, so we could weight the orientation by its excentricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have each building orientation we need to assign a orientation to each cell (in fact the orientation of each building is not relevant at the end). Here we need to understand and define how we will merge into a metric the orientation of many buildings on the same cell. There is no sense make things as the average of the buildings orientation. \n",
    "\n",
    "On this case we decided \"create\" a new building that is composed by all the fractions of the buildings that belong to the cell and calculate over all the points that compose this new object the PCA. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the PCA calculation has a step where moves the Polygon to the center of the region the position of each building (or building fraction) is not relevant. What is relevant is how much of each building is on each cell and the orientation of the entire building that fraction belows (we can't just cut the buildings parts that match the cell border). \n",
    "\n",
    "So, with the list of buildings that belong to the cell we make the first step of searching the small rectangle that contains the Polygon. Then we could join all the extremes of those rectangles and calculate the PCA over them. This is consistent with the logic of PCA because each rectangle will try to orientate the PCA to its own direction and the PCA will found a balance between all of them according to the area of each rectangle. Also on this logic we are not weighting more the buildings with more points because we just take the rectangle that contains the Polygon. The problem of this is that assumes that all buildings below completely to the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we will used the already calculated fraction of each building that belongs to the cell. If we reduce the area of the rectangle by the fraction of the building that belongs to the cell we will have a new rectangle that is more consistent with the real area of the building into that cell. Then we could build a more representative measure of the orientation of the buildings on the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have calculated the orientation and the covered area of each cell we have all the required information to represent the required information. We decided to create a heatmap to represent the covered area and a representation of lines to represent the orientation of the buildings on the cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries and tools utilized\n",
    "\n",
    "For general data processing we used Pandas and Geopandas (for transforming the raw data into polygons). \n",
